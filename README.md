## 📌 Overview

The **AI Waste Classifier** is an intelligent waste-sorting system built with deep learning. It classifies waste images into:

* ♻️ **Recyclable**
* 🌱 **Biodegradable**
* 🚯 **Non-Recyclable**

The model is trained using **EfficientNetB0** with transfer learning and fine-tuning, achieving **90%+ accuracy**.
A beautiful **Streamlit web app** allows users to:

* Upload an image
* Or take a picture using their camera
* Get real-time waste classification
* View confidence levels
* Receive proper disposal guidance

---

## ✨ Features

✔ Upload or take a picture
✔ Realtime predictions
✔ 3 waste categories
✔ Confidence level display
✔ AI-powered eco-friendly advice
✔ Beautiful UI with custom styling
✔ Mobile-friendly
✔ Works locally or on Streamlit Cloud

```

App opens at:

👉 [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

---

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset consists of three folders:

* `recyclable/`
* `biodegradable/`
* `non_recyclable/`

Originally sourced and reorganized from:

* Hazardous (ignored)
* Non-Recyclable
* Organic
* Recyclable

---

## 🧪 Training the Model

Training was done in Google Colab using:

* Dataset cleaning
* Preprocessing & augmentation
* Transfer learning (EfficientNetB0)
* Fine-tuning
* Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
* Saving final `.keras` model

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Mobile app (React Native / Flutter)
* TensorFlow Lite deployment
* Hardware integration with smart bins
* Enhanced multi-class waste categories
* Real-time object detection
